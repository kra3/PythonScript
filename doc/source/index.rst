   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PythonScript's documentation!

.. note:: If all you want is experiment with the language there is an `online editor <http://apppyjs.appspot.com/>`_.

Start by reading the howtos to learn more about the specific capabilities of PythonScript, then the remaining part if you feel advanturous and know javascript, how it's done.

Internals
=========

Reading the ``.py`` from the `forge <https://github.com/amirouche/PythonScript>`_ might give you a head start about how it works but without a good understanding of how `ast module <http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html>`_ works it will be difficult to understand all the magic. Is it useful ?
No. You don't need to understand how it works to use it, but since it's buggy (but usable) you might want to know what Python is converted to what Javascript to understand the errors that may arise and circuvent them and also you might learn something about Python or Javascript or both and contribute to PythonScript. Anyway most of the time trial and errror works perfectly!
